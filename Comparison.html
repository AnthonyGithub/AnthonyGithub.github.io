											<h3>Comparison</h3>
											<p>Factors that affect the strength of a pokemon:

<p><b>Base stats and IVs:</b>
            Out of our hands. Completely based on Pokemon for the former and luck for the latter.</p>

<p><b>Levels reached between time of capture to now:</b>
             The levels attained since time of capture till now are directly proportional to strength. A trained pokemon will always be stronger compared to a wild one of the same pokemon type and level.</p>

<p><b>EV Training:</b>
            We must know the strengths and weaknesses of our pokemon and allot a battle type to it like Tank, Sweeper etc.. and EV train it accordingly. We can max out only 2 of the 6 stats so we must be wise.</p>

<p><b>Move set:</b>
             As we all know, almost all pokemon can learn a huge variety of moves either through leveling up or evolution or TMs or HMs or Move Tutors.
Our moveset plays a very big role in our pokemon's strength as relative as it may be. It has to be well rounded, and in accordance with its battle class (tanker, sweeper etc..), its element type, and its EV points.</p>

<p><b>Element Type:</b>
            The pokemon's element type is key in deciding its moveset and planning a strategy because of bonus effects with respect to certain pairing of types. For example damage dealt by a Fire type on a Grass type is doubled. </p>

<p><b>Level:</b>
           Needless to say, its level will decide on his stat points which are very important for a strong pokemon. Also, in rare cases, if the pokemon's level is too high he/she may flip you off and go rogue.</p>

<p><b>Happiness:</b>
            His happiness will decide on his behaviour and battle style in battles like in the Battle Tower where you may have to let your pokemon do the battle on their own. For some pokemon, happiness also decides on their evolutions as well as the strength of certain moves like Return.</p>

<p><b>Evolution:</b>
            This is another important point that decides the strength of a pokemon. Some pokemon have options for evolution and we can control the time of evolution as well. That said, in some pokemon, evolving may give it a big stat bonus but your moveset becomes limited which effectively puts a stopper to your dream moveset for that pokemon. 
If you decide to evolve your pokemon after learning the required moveset, you will have skipped a few levels where you could have evolved him thereby losing stat bonuses. In our case, mewtwo is the only pokemon that can evolve through Mega Evolution</p>

<p><b>Berries and Items:</b>
            Pokemon can hold 1 berry or item and only 1. We must be clever in deciding which berry or item we give him to hold as this may just make or break your battle.</p>


<p>So, in conclusion, there is no such thing as the strongest pokemon. Every pokemon has weakness. It's like rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. They are all strong against some, weak against others. What they're strong against will be stronger than what is stronger against them.</p>
